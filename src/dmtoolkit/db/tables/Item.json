One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>\n<p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\n<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it.

Gax, later known to history as Gax the Great, was a mysterious figure renowned for his uncanny ability to weave together martial and magical combat in unique and powerful ways. An unparalleled master at crafting magic arms and armor, Gax is known for a number of fantastic, magical items. He is said to have created his first great item of magic when he was still a young apprentice. At that time, his master was an old wizard who mercilessly drilled the fundamentals of magic into the young apprentice's mind. The studious old wizard also derisively dismissed Gax's ideas for combining magic and battle and openly berated Gax for his love of swordplay, weaponry, and armor. Determined to prove that his theories were possible (and, truth be told, equally determined to spite his master), Gax apprenticed himself at the same time to a renowned weapon smith and armorer in a nearby town. The youth quickly proved as skilled at metalcraft as he was at magic. Young Gax spent his days in magical study and his nights working in the smith's forge, crafting an exquisite breastplate of the finest mithral. He imbued the breastplate's delicate glyphs and symbols with powerful protective magic far beyond the ability of magic-wielders many years his senior. When the breastplate was finally completed, Gax proudly showed it to his mentor. The smith was so impressed that he coveted it for himself, and he demanded that Gax give the breastplate to him. When Gax refused, the smith attempted to take it by force. At the end of a quick but violent scuffle, the smith lay dead near the very anvil on which Gax had finished his wondrous breastplate. Shocked and terrified, the boy fled, running to the small stone building where the old wizard lived. Hoping the wizard would be understanding about what happened and suitably impressed with Gax's magical breastplate, the boy breathlessly recounted recent events. The old wizard was neither understanding nor impressed. He coldly chided Gax for wasting his time on a \u201ctrinket\u201d and rebuked Gax for taking a life over \u201cnothing more than a worthless piece of pretty metal.\u201d Furious and defeated, Gax shouted profanities at his master before running off into the woods.

From soup to cheese, they told tales of a hero possessed of a \u201cFolding Door\u201d that fit in his pocket. When \u201cunfolded\u201d to full size it could be set anywhere (a stone wall, a tree, a waterfall) and opened to anywhere in the wide world, whisking the hero and her companions away from trouble in a trice. Too young to separate fact from fiction, yet old enough to recognize the prowess of their father, they asked me to craft them such a door. I explained that an object able to produce instant, multiple-location, inter-planar conjuration was impossible. To ease the sting of their disappointment, I explained that their story, while pure nonsense, was still interesting from an etymological standpoint. Centuries ago, a wizard named Foulton Konig was famed for creating magical doors. Sadly, specific details are lacking as his labs, libraries, and notes were lost when his mansion was destroyed in a catastrophically thorough, but historically non\u2011specific way. My children were fascinated to hear my theory that metaplasmic drift in the language (doubtless working in concert with poor education and rustic accents) eventually led a genuine product of magical artifice (a door made by Foulton) to eventually enter folklore as a \u201cFolding Door.\u201d This was my first brush with my eventual life's work and passion: my endless quest to separate the history of artifice from stories of the artificial. As such, I feel an odd gratitude toward their old governess, and occasionally feel a bit of remorse about ending her employment over the incident. Still, there are genuine wonders aplenty in the world without cluttering the minds of the young with nonsense. Mine is an endless struggle to separate fact from fancy, as shown by events of three months ago. Out conducting research, (while cunningly disguised to mix among the common folk) a seemingly reputable vendor of magical curiosities offered to sell me \u201ca fragment of a Foulton Door.\u201d (Note Fig 1. a splinter of wood, slightly longer than a handspan across.) Destroyed long ago, so powerful were the original doors that if even a small piece such as this were incorporated into an existing door, it would become imbued with the power of a magic portal. A quick check revealed the shard of wood <em>did</em>, in fact, possess a powerful, unfamiliar dweomer. With dubious curiosity, I bought it, returned to my lab, and followed their instructions. My tools and talents are not designed for anything so base as carpentry, but in the pursuit of truth I dutifully paid several hours of my precious time, a set of skinned knuckles, and one badly hammered thumb to patch the small piece of wood into one of the secondary pantry's doors. I then inserted the key to my winter lodgings, concentrated, and opened the door as the merchant had instructed me. Nothing happened, of course, and when I checked, the wood no longer showed any traces of magic. When I returned to the merchant to demand both an ethical and economic accounting, he had the audacity to imply it was my own fault, and refused to admit his obvious charlatanry or refund the twenty gold I had spent. While I regularly spend much greater sums in the course of my research, I nevertheless engaged the constabulary to bring the fellow into custody, as behavior such as this does nothing but defraud the simple-minded and tarnish the reputation of those engaging in legitimate arcane pursuits\u2026. Rumored to be pieces of destroyed magical doors, fragments of a <em>Foulton door</em> are varied in their shapes and sizes. Flinders of wood, bands of iron, screws, or even shards of broken glass are the most common, while intact and usable hinges, knobs, or entire planks of wood are rare. Although useless on their own, if you incorporate a fragment into an existing door, its magic allows that door to open to another location, even one on another plane of existence. The DC increases by 1 for each fragment added to a door beyond the first, but the DC can never be higher than 25. You can remove a fragment from a door by repeating the check, but removing a fragment doesn't result in a quirk. When a door has only one fragment, you can use an action to open the door to a door, doorway, or other similar entryway or egress of your choice within 100 miles of the door, and the travel is one\u2011way, meaning a creature that steps through the door can't step back through it. The door remains open for up to 1 minute. The door can't be used this way again until the next dawn. When a door has two or more fragments, it has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. Opening the door expends 1 charge. A door with three or more fragments develops unique characteristics. Choose a characteristic when you incorporate the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th fragments. At the GM's discretion, you can choose an additional characteristic for every three fragments beyond the 12th. You can choose each characteristic only once, unless the characteristic's description says otherwise. The characteristics are presented in alphabetical order. If a characteristic requires a number of fragments, the door must have at least that number of fragments to gain that characteristic. If a characteristic requires you to incorporate a nonmagical object, such as a pane of glass or doorknob, into the door, you must incorporate that item before you can use that characteristic. Incorporating a nonmagical object into the door doesn't result in a quirk, but failure means you didn't incorporate the object and must repeat the check to incorporate it. You can choose this characteristic more than once, increasing the number of locations to which the door can be bound. Each time you select it, you must incorporate a new object that can be turned into the door and that object must be one of the targets of the magical bond. If you previously incorporated an object with multiple sides, like a hanging lantern or a wheel with spokes, you can make a different side of that object the target of the magical bond instead of incorporating a new object. title: How many fragments for a full door?\nSince the fragment sizes are so variable, the number of fragments required to \u201ccomplete\u201d a <em>Foulton door</em> is at the GM's discretion. Most adventurers go their entire lifetimes without ever constructing more than half a <em>Foulton door</em>, and there is no reason the players or GM should feel obligated to create a full door out of the fragments. Some groups might never have more than three fragments while others might have twenty. As the GM, choose whatever number or style best fits your group and the story you all want to tell. The variability of the characteristics, fragment powers, and quirks leave you and your group plenty of room to make the door as complex, unique, and fragmented as you need it to be. Each fragment you incorporate into a door increases the door's power. When you incorporate a fragment into the door, roll a d100 and consult the Fragment Powers table. Alternatively, your GM might choose a specific power for the fragment you incorporate, such as an iron band fragment that increases the door's damage threshold or an old, battered doorknob that leads to a particular plane of the Hells. Roll: [[Foulton Door#^powers]] | dice: 1d% | Power |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1-20 | The distance the destination can be from the door's current location increases by 100 miles. |\n| 21-40 | The door's hit points increase by 10. |\n| 41-55 | The door can remain open for 1 additional minute. |\n| 56-70 | The door's damage threshold increases by 2. |\n| 71-80 | The door's maximum number of charges increases by 1. The door regains a number of expended charges daily at dawn equal to the nearest die type, rounded down ( 1d4 for 5 charges, 1d6 for 6 charges, etc.). |\n| 81-90 | The door's Armor Class increases by 1. |\n| 91-95 | The door has immunity to one additional type of damage (GM's choice). |\n| 96-100 | The door can travel to one additional plane (GM's choice). | When you incorporate a fragment into a door, you must make an appropriate tool check, as detailed in the <em>Foulton door</em> entry. When you succeed or fail by 5 or more, the door gains a quirk. Here we present tables of the types of quirks the door can acquire. Lesser quirks happen if the check succeeds (positive) or fails (negative) by 5\u20139. Greater quirks happen if the check succeeds (positive) or fails (negative) by 10 or more. When the door develops a quirk, consult the appropriate Quirks table, rolling the indicated die. Alternatively, your GM might choose a quirk that best fits the group or the situation of the success or failure. At the GM's discretion, if the door has a quirk you want to remove, spells such as <em>fabricate</em>, <em>greater restoration</em>, or <em>remove curse</em> might remove one or all of a door's quirks. Alternatively, the GM might require you to complete a specific task related to the quirk before removing it. (For ability checks that fail by 5-9) | d8 | Quirk |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 | Each creature that steps through the door exits the other side soaking wet as if it just stepped out of a lake. |\n| 2 | The first time a creature steps through the door each day, it decreases in size by 10 percent. This effect lasts until the creature is targeted by the <em>remove curse</em> spell or similar magic. |\n| 3 | If a dangerous creature with an Intelligence of 4 or lower is within 100 feet of the destination, the door magically attracts the creature to come to the door. |\n| 4 | Travel through the door is no longer instantaneous. Each creature that steps through the door arrives at the destination 10 minutes after it stepped through the door at the origin. |\n| 5 | Stepping through the door causes vertigo and mild nausea. Each creature that steps through the door is poisoned for 1 minute. |\n| 6 | The door makes noise, such as creaky hinges, a dinging bell, a trumpet blast, or similar loud sound, when it is opened, which is audible within 100 feet of the door at the origin and destination locations. |\n| 7 | The door dampens sound for travelers. Each creature that steps through the door is deafened for 10 minutes. |\n| 8 | The door brings misfortune on travelers. Each creature that steps through the door is affected by the <em>bane</em> spell for 1 hour. | (For ability checks that succeed by 5-9) | d8 | Quirk |\n| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 | When you open the door, there is a 25 percent chance ( 1d%: &lt;= 25) the door doesn't expend a charge. |\n| 2 | Each time a creature steps through the door, it exits the other side clean, with freshly mended and laundered clothes, neatly trimmed hair, or similar signs of cleanliness. |\n| 3 | If a dangerous creature with an Intelligence of 4 or lower is within 100 feet of the destination, the door magically repulses the creature, discouraging it from coming within 100 feet of the door. |\n| 4 | Each creature that steps through the door can't be frightened for 1 hour. |\n| 5 | Stepping through the door invigorates travelers. Each creature that steps through the door has advantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute. |\n| 6 | Each creature that steps through the door becomes aesthetically pleasing to other creatures and has advantage on Charisma checks to interact socially with other creatures for 10 minutes. |\n| 7 | The door becomes more accepting of new fragments. Any creature incorporating a fragment has advantage on the check. |\n| 8 | The door brings fortune on travelers. Each creature that steps through the door is affected by the <em>bless</em> spell for 1 hour. | (For ability checks that fail by 10+) | d6 | Quirk |\n| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 | The door always arrives at a dangerous location within 1 mile of the desired destination, unless the desired destination is already dangerous. |\n| 2 | Once opened, the door must remain open for its full duration. |\n| 3 | Travel through the door is no longer instantaneous. Each creature that steps through the door arrives at the destination 1 hour after it stepped through the door at the origin. This quirk replaces the lesser negative quirk that also makes the door's travel no longer instantaneous, if the door has that quirk. |\n| 4 | Each creature that steps through the door must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 10 + the number of fragments in the door). On a failure, a creature arrives at the destination but is incapacitated for 1 minute. |\n| 5 | When the door closes, it can't be reopened for 1 hour. |\n| 6 | When you open the door, it expends 2 charges instead of 1. | (For ability checks that succeed by 10+) | d6 | Quirk |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 | When you open the door, there is a 50 percent chance the door doesn't expend a charge. This quirk replaces the lesser positive quirk that also gives the door a chance to not expend a charge, if the door has that quirk. |\n| 2 | If the destination location is dangerous, the door grows warm to the touch and is \u201cstuck\u201d for a moment when you try to open it, requiring you to pull or push a second time to open the door fully. |\n| 3 | You no longer need a key to open the door. You must still use an action and expend a charge (or charges if the door has that quirk) to open the door. In addition, if the door has the Foulton's Key characteristic, the maximum number of Foulton Keys you can tie to the door increases to 4. |\n| 4 | The door becomes more accepting of new fragments. The DC to incorporate a fragment reduces by 5. |\n| 5 | The Fragment Power of the fragment you incorporated into the door when you received this quirk becomes more potent. The fragment's numerical power is doubled. For example, if the fragment's power increases the distance the door can travel by 100 miles, it increases that distance by 200 miles instead. |\n| 6 | Each creature that steps through the door regains 2d6 hit points. When a creature regains hit points in this way, it can't regain hit points by stepping through the door again until it finishes a short or long rest. |</p>", "rarity": "fabled ", "cost": null, "attunement": "", "duration": "", "damage_dice": null, "damage_type": null, "weight": null, "ac_string": null, "strength_requirement": null, "properties": null, "tables": []}, "574": {"pk": 574, "name": "Fountmail", "image": {"url": null, "asset_id": 0, "raw": null}, "desc": "<p>This armor is a dazzling white suit of chain mail with an alabaster-colored steel collar that covers part of the face.

Gax always told his friend that true strength comes from within, but Riggs continued to lament his physical weakness and size.

When wearing the gauntlets, Riggs gained great strength and found his magic enhanced in wondrous ways. In time, Gax and Riggs came to a small village near a high mountain pass. The people there welcomed the strangers, who happily remained in the village for many weeks. Then, the giants attacked. Gax and Riggs battled the giants and did everything they could to defend the village. Riggs used the power of his gauntlets to great effect, but in the end, he found it was his bravery and willingness to give his life to protect the villagers that truly won the day.

Bronwyn carried that golden feather with him for many months. Eventually, he had a magical shield crafted to honor his fallen friend. Bronwyn watched as the expert craftsman's hammer fell repeatedly on the new shield, giving it shape and form. Just as the last hammer blow fell, Brownwyn tossed the feather onto the shield. The plumage vanished as the craftsman's hammer struck, as if the golden feather had somehow fused with the metal. At that moment, the sleek image of a griffon appeared on the shield's surface, glowing with a soft, amber light. Bronwyn named the shield <em>Golden Griffon</em>.

Lord Ventu held tremendous sway in the kingdom, and he brought that considerable power to bear on his self-appointed mission of wiping out every last practitioner of magic in the land who wielded magic without the blessing of a deity. Thus began the <em>Purge Arcana</em>. To carry out the <em>Purge Arcana</em>, Ventu needed loyal warriors who could seek out and destroy practitioners of the arcane arts. To this end, he assembled a squad of like-minded zealots, and he outfitted them with breastplates enchanted by priests of his deity to neutralize magic and aid in killing those that wielded it. For years, Ventu's Mage Hunters scoured his kingdom, killing anyone who dared to practice magic. It was a dark and dangerous time, filled with fear and paranoia. Over time, Ventu grew increasingly paranoid, and his actions became more and more bizarre. Eventually, he decided that even his own Mage Hunters had become tainted by prolonged contact with the very magic that they were tasked to destroy. He summoned his most loyal soldiers and ordered them to round up and murder the Mage Hunters. For the Mage Hunters, it was the final straw. Many fled the kingdom in fear, but a few banded together and stormed Ventu's fortress. They killed the mad zealot then looked on his lifeless body in shocked disbelief. The Mage Hunters were appalled at what they had done, but they were even more appalled at what had transpired in the kingdom. It was as if Ventu had woven a spell on everyone and, now that he was dead, the spell was broken. The Mage Hunters disbanded.

When the beautiful mermaid's eyes finally fluttered open, Lord Markum fell deeply and hopelessly in love. The mermaid explained that her people were suffering relentless attacks from a tribe of sahuagin. The mermaid had been wounded during the last raid and had washed upon the rocks near Lord Markum's keep. Markum was desperate to help. He was a powerful warrior, but he could not simply hold his breath and wade into the sea with his plate mail and great sword. He called for his oldest and most trusted advisor, the wizard Pelgroth. Together, Markum, a skilled weapon smith, and Pelgroth, an accomplished magic crafter, set out to even the odds. The result was a mighty glaive enchanted with powerful water magic. Markum lifted the great weapon and felt the power of the sea rise inside him. They swam at once into the deep until they came to the merfolk's glittering, coral city. When the next raid occurred, Markum battled the sahuagin relentlessly and rallied the merfolk warriors, pressing on until every sahuagin was slain. Now a hero to the merfolk, Markum and the mermaid were soon married. From that day onward, Lord Markum fought alongside the merfolk, until the terrible day he was slain by a powerful four\u2011armed sahuagin, who took <em>Markum's glaive</em> as a battle trophy.

Ruatha rushed through the forest, shouting for the animals to run toward the safety of the stream. Ruatha could hear the deep, rumbling voice of Oak Heart in the distance, rousing the trees of the forest.

Glancing around quickly, the exhausted druid was relieved to see that most of the forest animals had made it to safety, as had many of the trees. They were already re-rooting themselves into the ground and becoming still again. Coughing uncontrollably, the exhausted young druid collapsed on the ground. Ruatha's eyes flickered open. It was dawn and the storm was over. On the far side of the stream, Ruatha could see the devastation left behind by the forest fire. As far as the eye could see, the ground was black and burned. Ruatha noticed a large, still shape in the distance, near a group of smoldering tree trunks. His heart sank\u2014it was Oak Heart. The druid transformed into a hawk and soared to his friend. Oak Heart was dead, his bark blackened and charred. The ancient treant had died trying to save every last tree he could.

After these 24 hours have passed, the power drains from the mirror, and it can't be activated again until it is recharged.

Justicars are arbiters of law and order, operating independently of any official city guard or watch divisions.

These stern sentinels are overseen by The Magister, a powerful wizard of whom little is known other than their title.

Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed. The Justicars are outfitted with three symbols of authority that are also imbued with power: their masks, rods, and rings.

The benefits don't set in until 30 minutes after the crops were harvested, and any uneaten crops disappear at that time.

Owain went to great lengths to ensure the safety, prosperity, and well-being of his people. He believed all people, regardless of their station in life, deserved to be treated fairly and equally. He codified the realm's first set of laws, and he even specified that no one, not even a king, was above the law. The reign of King Owain the Lion was truly a golden age. On the anniversary of Owain's 30th year on the throne, his lords commissioned a magnificent golden scepter to commemorate the king's long and just reign. Royal wizards and high clerics of the realm bestowed powerful protective magic upon the scepter, which was then presented to the appreciative king. By the time King Owain had reached his seventieth year, he was in failing health. The King transferred power to his young son, Prince Tarrgrin, during a solemn ceremony in which he formally turned over his <em>sovereign's scepter</em> to the young prince. Less than a year later, the great king, the Protector of the Realm, died peacefully in his sleep. The people had hoped that Owain's son would be as wise, strong, and just as his father had been. Alas, it was not to be. Although Tarrgrin tried to live up to his father's example, he was in truth but a shadow of the ruler King Owain had been. Within a few years, most of the lords were in open rebellion. Bitter, furious, and increasingly paranoid, Tarrgrin rejected his father's laws and swiftly imprisoned anyone suspected of treason. The kingdom was soon ripped apart by a bloody civil war. Eventually, the capital city was taken. King Tarrgrin was captured and beheaded, and in the chaos that followed, the <em>sovereign's scepter</em> disappeared. Perhaps it was taken by one of the lords; perhaps it was accidentally destroyed. There are many that believe someone loyal to King Owain's memory took the scepter and hid it away. Rumors say that, when someone truly worthy of Owain's ideals comes forward, the <em>sovereign's scepter</em> will be found once again.

To gain the benefits from spirit honey, you must consume it. When you eat spirit honey, you gain its benefits and a long-term madness for 1d10 x 10 hours. If you suffer the madness of the spirit honey for the full duration, you gain insight into some aspect of the universe. If your madness is cured before the end of the duration, you lose all benefits of the spirit honey, and you don't gain the insight. The <em>calm emotions</em> spell can temporarily suppress the madness caused by the spirit honey for the duration of the spell, but you also lose the benefits of the spirit honey for that same duration. The use of this spell doesn't negatively impact you receiving insight at the end of the spirit honey's duration.</p>", "rarity": "varies", "cost": null, "attunement": "", "duration": "", "damage_dice": null, "damage_type": null, "weight": null, "ac_string": null, "strength_requirement": null, "properties": null, "tables": []}, "968": {"pk": 968, "name": "Splinter Staff", "image": {"url": null, "asset_id": 0, "raw": null}, "desc": "<p>This roughly made staff has cracked and splintered ends and can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff.

Osland had already killed two dragons in his lifetime and was determined to make Vrithmytrix his third. Shouting a challenge of honor, the knight attacked! After the titanic battle, Vrithmytrix, the mighty black dragon, was dead. Osland hauled the black dragon's body back to his keep. There, he commissioned the creation of a wonderous suit of armor made from Vrithmytrix's scales and hide. He christened the armor <em>Vrithmytrix's Bane</em><strong>.</strong> Over time, Osland discovered that many of the black dragon's unique qualities had somehow carried over to the armor itself! One dark night almost a year later, Osland felt his entire keep shake. Rushing outside, he saw a large portion of the outer wall had been reduced to rubble, and a massive black dragon was circling overhead. As the terrible beast soared closer, its reptilian eyes widened at the sight of Osland's armor, then quickly narrowed in abject hatred. This was Vrithmytrix's mate, and it was much larger and more powerful than Vrithmytrix had been. Roaring in anger, the dragon swooped down, snatched Osland in its great claws and carried him away into the night sky. Osland was never seen again.

Two packs, each aggressive and dangerous, fought violently for dominance within a large forest, but neither could gain the upper hand. Both sides eventually suffered such losses that the two clans soon found themselves at the mercy of human hunters intent on killing them all. To ensure their survival, the werewolf leaders reluctantly agreed to bury their hatred for one another and the two diminished packs became one. To seal the alliance, each werewolf bestowed a gift upon the other. One pack leader gave the other a magical ring he named <em>wolf 's howl</em>. In return, the first pack leader was given a magical horn. For a time, the joined pack existed peacefully, and their combined might allowed them to rule the forest once again. However, the werewolf who possessed the magical horn grew disenchanted. He felt that his gift, the <em>wolf 's howl ring</em>, was far greater than the horn he had been given. He believed that the other werewolf pack leader had intentionally given him an inferior gift in order to slight him. Tensions grew between the two werewolves. When the inevitable breaking point came, the ensuing battle involved not only the leaders, but the entire pack. When the bloodbath was over, few of the werewolves remained alive. The victorious werewolf leader bathed his <em>wolf 's howl ring</em> in the blood of his enemy, and the ring absorbed the creature's dying essence into itself. The triumph was short-lived, however. The few survivors of the battle, including the werewolf leader, fell to the silvered arrows of hunters only a few days later.
